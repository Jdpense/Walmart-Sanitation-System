# Walmart-Sanitation-System
The struggles with dealing with the recurring strains of Covid-19 on Walmart’s products are dealt with through the invented software known as, “The Walmart Sanitation System”. The 
Walmart Sanitation System solves the issues with Covid-19 strains by allowing the user to select the name of any food product vended by Walmart’s franchise and press the “scan” 
button for the software to scan the desire food product for any trace of viruses that could potentially surround or be embedded in the food. Once the scanning process of a food 
product on the software begins, the software will record the number and types of viruses that were traced, and the software should feedback to the user the results of the scanning
process with the strains traced and found. Once the scanning process is finished, the total number of found strains of viruses with be temporarily stored in the main menu of the 
software for archive purposes until the user exits out of the program. The Walmart Sanitation system will remedy the problem of being able to track and avoid strains of Covid-19.
